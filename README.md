<img width="1983" height="3967" alt="4c156990d7d54d2f9e3c4830885b3942_T" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/70c98c76-e38a-4b23-818e-86021ef153a1" />

## Version 1.0
High-reliability camera control and downlink board built around the **STM32F405RGT6**, designed for UTS Rocketry’s flight avionics stack.  
The board provides **camera power switching**, **camera UART control**, **video downlink support**, and **CAN-based communication** with the central avionics system.

## Project Overview
The CameraBoard is a custom PCB designed to interface action cameras with the UTS Rocketry avionics system.  
It provides:

- **Reliable power delivery** to the camera through a load-switch architecture  
- **UART-based camera control** (start/stop recording, mode switching, etc.)  
- **Video downlink support** (placeholder until RF/video module is finalised)  
- **CAN Bus** connectivity for inter-module communication  
- **Debug UART** and activity LEDs  
- **5V → 3.3V power tree** and full onboard decoupling network  

Built around the **STM32F405RGT6**, chosen for performance, CAN support, and strong STM32 ecosystem compatibility.
